# Program-2---CS010C


This C++ program provides a user interface for managing a Binary Search Tree (BST) through a series of menu-driven operations. The user can insert and remove strings, print the tree's traversal orders (preorder, inorder, postorder), search for specific strings, and query details such as the smallest and largest strings in the tree. Additionally, the program allows the user to determine the height of the subtree rooted at a specific string. The menu function presents these options, and the main function executes the selected operations, interacting with the BSTree class to perform the required tasks. This setup enables users to dynamically modify and query a binary search tree using a simple text-based interface.
